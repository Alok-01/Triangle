While Buliding API, need work on following points. 
This is not required to implement everything, based on feature and project demand.
However Any Archiecture should keep these things

1) Uniform Interface Constraint
API and consumer share one single interface :
a) URI (Resorce Identifier)
b) HTTP Method
c) Media Type [Payload]

Resource Identification: it mean that individual resource are identified in 
request using URIs.

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application state): Allows 
for a self documententing API

Cacheable Constriant: Each response message must explicity state that if 
it can be cached or not

Paging Through Collection Resources

Deferred Execution: Means that the query vairable itself never holds the
query results and only stores the query commands. Execution of the query 
is deferred until the query variable is iterated over.
So deferred execution means that query execution occurs sometime after the
query is constructed. We can get this behavior by working with IQueryable
implementing collections. IQueryable of T allows us to execute a query against
a specific data source and while building upon it, it creates an expression 
tree that those query commands. But query itself isnot actually sent to the
datastore until iteration happens. e.g. foreach loop, ToList(), ToArray(),ToCount()
